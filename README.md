# Basketball League Stats Calculator

<b>Purpose</b>
This program is meant to calculate the general stats for a mock basketball league. The statistics such as Points per Game, Assists per Game, Steals per Game, Blocks per Game, Steals per Game, and Turnovers per Game will be calculated. This will be a Single-Conference league with rankings. Tie-breakers are decided based on head to head matchups (so for example if the Dragons and the Leprechauns both have the same record but the Leprechauns have more wins over the Dragons than the Dragons have over the Leprechauns, then the Leprechauns will be ranked higher).

There will also be a statistical MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Coach of the Year given specific calculations within my algorithm.

I hope to further my understanding of data analysis while showing my aptitude with various packages such as Numpy.
